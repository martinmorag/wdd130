        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        I want my website to be about myself and my ability to become a web developer, I want an attractive home page that shows a littel bit about myself, where I come from, what is it that I like and why I created the website. I want also to include some pictures of me, my home town and of course a simple header and footer but at the same, I want all of my website including the footer and the header to reflect how I am, or more like the style of websites that I like. I come from a little so I think I can either understand the tranquility of a simple website that tries to help people get what they want and also understand a bold website that tries to get everyone's attention because the people managing the website know that what they offer is something everybody should know about.

      </ul>
      <h3>Samples</h3>
      <p>
        One of the child pages should have some of the websites I have created and show the different types of work I am able to give and the type of website quality that my clients are able to get. I think that what I can offer is better for all of my clients because I can get something beautiful in every way, I am someone who can really wants to see the other person satisfied, I can't settle for something less than the true satisfaction and I love watching a person happy with what he or she got, I know that is a long way until I can say that the other person is happy with his or her website, there are going to be a lot of times in which we will have to do many changes, maybe at the beginning the client wants something and something happens and the client wants to change it a little bit or maybe he or she realized that that wasn't really what it was looking for we try something different, and it will be okay and I know that I will enjoy every change, every evolution of what I'm creating for another person and it is something I really look forward to, this is something that I want other people to achieve, not just a website but a website they are comfortable and happy with, that is something everyone can get and they will get if they talk to me about it, I will be more than happy to be a part of it.

      </ul>
      <h3>Contact Me</h3>
      <p>
        The other child page is going to be dedicated to contact me, it will have different ways for the potential client to contact me, email, WhatsApp, and all of my social media, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. In the future maybe I will make some actual social media accounts dedicated to my work, but so far it will be my personal social media accounts. Maybe in this child page I will include eventually some payment methods, along with some pricing, offers and everything related to it. As I am beginninf my path of a web developer I will not be asking huge amounts of money for my work, I will make a reputation of my own first, make myself know among all of the people and comapanies involved in this industry, I have a lot of experience and talent regarding treating people the way that they deserve. I believe that I will be able to get along with clients and also colleagues, people that can help me and that I can help too. My contact will be open for everyone, everyone will be able to take a look at what I do.
